## Creating Python Virtual Environment

To run the project, you'll first need to create a python virtual environment with specific dependencies installed. The packages needed can be found at this
'''clc_packages''' repository. Link: https://bitbucket.org/LauFoo/clc_packages/src/master/

1. Create a **python virtual environment** with ```pyvenv``` packages and ```venv``` command
2. Go to ```clc_packages``` repository and clone it, make a **local repository**
3. **Activate** the virtual environment with the line ```(name_of_venv)\Scripts\activate```
4. Change the directory to the one containing ```setup.py``` for each package and install it with the line ```python setup.py install```
5. In the terminal type ```pip freeze``` to check the list of packages installed in your virtual environment.
